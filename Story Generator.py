'''
Goal: Write a short story using Python variables. The story will have 4 sentences and include certain characters, a place, something important, an action, and a goal.

How to do it:

Start your Python script by creating six variables. Each variable will hold a piece of information for your story:

main_character: The name of your main character.
secondary_character: The name of another character.
location: Where the story happens.
object: Something important in your story.
action: What your main character is doing.
destination: Where your main character is trying to go.
Set (assign) values to these variables. These values will shape your story.
Use string concatenation (joining strings together with a +) to create a story from these variables.
Your story should have four sentences. Each sentence should include at least one of your variables and make sense in the context of the story.
Print your final story so it shows up in the console.

Example: Here's how you might define your variables and print the story:

main_character = "Alice"
secondary_character = "the White Rabbit"
location = "the rabbit hole"
object = "a mysterious key"
action = "chasing"
destination = "a rabbit hole"

print(main_character + " began " + action + " " + secondary_character + " down " + destination)

What You Will Achieve: This task helps you understand how to use variables and string concatenation in Python. It's also a fun way to see how coding can be creative!

Remember:

Start your script with comments that include these instructions. Comments in Python start with #.  Also, explain what each part of the code is doing in your own words.
The provided code is an incomplete example. Create your own completely original, unique story made up of 4 sentences.
You must use concatenation (+)
Do not use input statements.  Assign values to the variables in the code

main_character = "Kio"  # name of our main character assigned to main_character variable
secondary_character = "mouse" # name of our secondary character assigned to secondary_character variable
location = "dining table" # place assigned to variable named location
object="tennis ball" # tennis ball assigned to object variable
action="chasing" #chasing string assigned to action variable
destination="staircase" # name of place assigned to destination

print(main_character + " is my house cat.") # print variable and string using concatenation
print(main_character + " was playing around with a " + object + " on the " + location + ".")    # print second line of story with variable and string using concatenation
print ("Suddenly, " + main_character +" saw a " + secondary_character + " right under the " + location + ".")  # print third line of story with variable and string using concatenation
print(main_character + " then began " + action + " the " + secondary_character + " and caught the " + secondary_character + " under the " +destination +".") # print fourth line of story with variable and string using concatenation
